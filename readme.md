# Instruct Junior PHP Developer Code Challenge

### Tasks brief summary:

1. Create a **PHP command line (CLI) program** that will allow us to query this data based on COUNTRY CODE
   (e.g. allow us to display all services provided by Germany)
2. The CLI should also be able to produce a summary output, showing the total number of services in each
   country.

### How to use the program:

1. Once the project is downloaded from github,
   cd command to the project directory in your terminal. **Run composer install**

2. Type:

php index.php **instruction** :

• Get_Service_By_Country
• Service_Summary

Followed by **country code** :

• Country code single value for example:
o Uk
o Fr
o And so on…

For example run:

```
php index.php get_service_by_country gb

```

```
php index.php get_service_by_country fr

```

```
php index.php service_summary

```
